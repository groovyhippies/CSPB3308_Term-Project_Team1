**Additional Comments:**
After analyzing and discussing our Miro Board story, we approved of our checkpoints, finished creating ending and are deciding to go forward with writing our story into the story.json file. We agreed upon a naming convention for the nodes and will be using our own branches to prevent overwriting each other's work. We will continue to communicate via Discord if we have any additional questions. The deadline for our respective checkpoints being written in JSON is 6/27/25, Friday EOD.

**Additional Comments:**
We all finished our JSON story nodes, however, we ran into an issue with merging our branches. The merge conflict resulted in an accidental override of our previous commits, which made parts of our story nodes disappear. To resolve this, we met together as a team and agreed to revert the repository to before the problem merge. We then collaborated closely to walk through the merge process which helped us understand the root of the issue. By working as a team, we were able to restore lost content and plan for how to proceed in the future.
