**Additional Comments:**
After analyzing and discussing our Miro Board story, we approved of our checkpoints, finished creating ending and are deciding to go forward with writing our story into the story.json file. We agreed upon a naming convention for the nodes and will be using our own branches to prevent overwriting each other's work. We will continue to communicate via Discord if we have any additional questions. The deadline for our respective checkpoints being written in JSON is 6/27/25, Friday EOD.
